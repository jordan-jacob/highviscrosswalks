# highviscrosswalks
This repository goes along with Jacob Jordan's research paper on the comparative safety of high-visibility and low-visibility crosswalks. All the manipulated data referenced in that project is available here, as well as the R files needed to replicate the graphs and the statistical analysis. Feel free to browse and take what you want!
<br /> <br />
TorontoCrosswalksFinal.csv contains all data for each intersection, while TorontoCrosswalksCrashVehiclePed.csv contains only the necessary data for the charts and statistical tests.
