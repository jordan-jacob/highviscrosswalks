# highviscrosswalks
This repository goes along with Jacob Jordan's research paper on the comparative safety of high-visibility and low-visibility crosswalks. All the data referenced in that project is available here and is attributed to the City of Toronto. Also, the R files needed to replicate the graphs and the statistical analysis are here. Feel free to browse and take what you want!
